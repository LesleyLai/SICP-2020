; The default if statement is a special form which means that even when an interpreter follows 
; applicative substitution, it only evaluates one of its parameters- not both. However, the newly 
; created new-if doesn't have this property and hence, it never stops calling itself due to the third 
; parameter passed to it in sqrt-iter.
